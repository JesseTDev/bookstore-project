Bookstore project, where users can take advantage of our google intergration to search for books via genre or author. Account details can be saved, and there is a user sign up login flow which intergrates with firebase. Books can be added to a virtual cart and can go through a checkout like process.

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>

- React
- React Router
- useContext / useReducer
- Styled-components
- MUI
- Firebase

<h3>Notes</h3>

- React was chosen because I aim to become a junior react developer and for its capabilities  and ui development.
- Full global state, utilising useContext / useReducer to practice this particular state management concept.
- For the CSS, it is a mixture of styled-components and MUI. It was outside the scope of this project to configure CRA / styled-components / MUI to work together.
- Created some custom components and some from MUI to get used to both approaches to ui development.
- Intergrated with firebase for data storage and user authentication to practice intergrating with third party api's.
